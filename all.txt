The Platt amendment nu• thorlzcs American Intervention In the Island In cnsc that country'& stability Is thrcntcncd. ,Asked to comment on the hear• lni;:s now being held by the House Ways nnd Means Committee as toa posslblo lncm1so In Sugar tnr!II schedules, the .C11b11nAmb11ss11dor said thnt It would be an anncllron- lsm to cripple economic rel11ttons between the United States and Cuba "while a treaty Is In existence which binds us so intimately to- gether poutlcnlly,l'OLlTICAL BREAK HINTED"To break tho economic ties nnturally would presuppose also a rupture or po!!tlcnl tie.~," ho ncldecl."As fnr us Cuba ls concerned," the Ambassador declared, "we nl• w11yshave !ulfllled nll our obliga- tions under the polltlcnl treaty. We always have malntatned a state or growing !rlendshlp and good will toward tho United stnte.s. We always have followed all of the United States' International nttl• tudcs with the greatest sympRthy, This, or courne, we wlll continue to do, because we cannot forget the tics that bind us both In the polit- ical and the moral field."Dr. Ferrnra said that In opposing Increases In sugar tariffs the Cuban government really Is defending the rights or American cltlzcns who have Invested more than $800,000,• 000 In Cubnn sugar. "This Invest• ment ha.s already, as a matter o! !net, sul!ered great losses and there ts now the risk that It may be v.iped out altogether," he added.DENIES COMPETITIONThe Ambassador mnlntatned that Cuban sugar docs not compete with American sugar but v.1th that of the Philippines, Porto Rico nnd Hawnl!, countries In which the standard or 11.!e and wage levels are so much lower thnn in Cuba that their products are cheaper. The.,e countries, however, he added, have the additional advantage of tariffs against Cuban sugar which almost double the cost or the Int• ter. "In other words," lie said, "Cuba, which pays more to Its workers, must sell Its product.~ at a price hnl! or thnt or Ph!l!pp!ne, Porto Rican and Hnwa!tan sugar."Dr. Ferrara emphasized that when Cuba accepted the Platt amendment, the promises or cco• nomlc co-operation, gl\'en by Presl• dent.~McKinley and Roosevelt and by former Secretary of State Elihu Root, never permitted the possibil- ity to be envisioned that Cuba would pay to the United States $150,000,000nnnunlly 1n customs dues, or 65 per cent or their value. while the United States only pays to Cuba $24,000,000o;r only 16per cent of the value orits Imports into the Island. This, Ile said, Is the present case, In which Cuba pnys the Unit• eel States more than the combineci custom dues pnld by Englnncl, France and Germany, America's greatest importers.  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

To con- tinue the pre.;ent policy, he said., would be in accordance with the free trade principle whlcll should be accorded the L~hmds so long as they remain under the American flng.

By. ·ers, reprinted by Wallnce Hebbrird, Santn Barbnra, Is a book of per-sonal rcmlnJsceni:cs dealing with some· of the bloodiest battles of theCivil War. The author spent n full four yenrs· In the service ns private, sergeant, adjutant nnd member of Oen. Sherman's staff, During flf. teen months of this period he wn.s confined to Ltbby and various south- ern prisons. .The book Is totully free from the bitterness that uRcd lo mark ·most or the ,volumes dcallni; with that period. It.~ vah1e lies chleny In the faithful and lnt.lmat.P.picture the author gh•cs or the actual life of,the soldier, In battles, In camp and In prison.Those interested 1n the Pueblo Inclians should not overlook Leo Crane's '.'Desert Drums; The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, 1540-1928,'' which Little, Drown & Co. published this !nil. It was recently reviewed In this department, but ls worth another mention because the author Is a. recognized authority on thePueblo Indians, and because the book, with Its fifty lllustrations. Is a fine example or the bookmaker's art.One or Am~ greatest pur- suits Is trying to discuss what the public wants. Many glib generaliza- tions about reading preferences are Impaired by one of the amazing current phenomena In the world or books. Two outstanding books are of the most widely divergent types: "Bambi, a Life In the Woods," by Felix Salten, a lyrical story of a forest deer, and "Show Girl," n. gay frenzy or Broadway. , According to the publishers, Simon , & Sclm5ter, both books arc motch- I Ing, stride for stride, on the best-seller llsts all over the country; proving again, first, that there is no one American public, and, sec- ond, that the unpredictables and the Ynrlables or public preference give spice ond zest to what the pub- lL5hersplayfuUy call "the noun and adjective racket."~OOl(S..-/andTheir Makers Gossipof theBook WorldMuch unpublished material of the secret Goncourt Journal appears for the first time In Ma.tthcw Joseph- son's "Zola. and His Time," the first biography of Zola In English to BP• pear in the last twenty-five years. Recently the heirs of Zola threat- ened to bring action In court tor the recovery or publication or these letters. but their contents were deemed too dangerotL5to make pub- lic.

So he sent a mes- senger to ask some man creature if the report were true-and as it hadn't the least Iden what a man looked like, its adventures were many."Magic Gold," by Marlon Florence Lansing, 1s the story of two Rogers -the 12-year-old heir or Haddon Towers and Roger Bacon, the fa- mous scientist-friar, who visits the castle and teaches the boy secret.~ of alchemy.
